✅ 1. Architecture & Deployment Model

Ask Sonatype:
	1.	Is a hybrid setup officially supported?
	•	On-prem Nexus Repository Pro + SaaS Nexus Firewall/Lifecycle.
	2.	How does the SaaS component connect to the on-prem Nexus?
	•	Agents? Connectors? Outbound-only traffic? Firewall ports?
	3.	What are the network prerequisites for hybrid mode?
	•	IP ranges, protocols, required outbound URLs, proxy compatibility.
	4.	Where is the data processed? (EU region required?)
	5.	What happens if SaaS Firewall/Lifecycle is temporarily unreachable?
	•	Does the on-prem repo continue working? What is degraded?

⸻

✅ 2. Security, Compliance & SBOM

Ask Sonatype:
	6.	How are SBOMs handled across hybrid setups?
	•	Are SBOMs stored in SaaS? on-prem?
	•	Export/import formats: CycloneDX, SPDX?
	7.	Does Firewall block bad components before they’re stored on-prem?
	•	Or after they land in quarantine?
	8.	What license policies can be pre-defined?
	•	MIT/Apache allowed? GPL/LGPL restricted?
	•	Does SaaS push policy updates to on-prem automatically?
	9.	Does Lifecycle provide transitive dependency analysis for Java, Python, Node, etc.
	•	What about Scala/SBT?

⸻

✅ 3. CI/CD Integration

(This matters because you have GitLab CE + Jenkins on-prem and GitHub Actions in cloud.)

Ask Sonatype:
	10.	How does Lifecycle integrate with multi-CI: GitLab CE, Jenkins, GitHub Actions?
	11.	Do we get build-time enforcement?

	•	Example: blocking merge if a certain severity is detected.

	12.	Do you provide native plugins for Maven, Gradle, npm, Python?
	13.	Does SaaS Lifecycle require developers to authenticate?

	•	Or is it service-to-service?

	14.	Can we automate policy evaluation in Pull Requests?

⸻

✅ 4. Repository Governance & Quarantine

(Critical because you want to replicate your manual artifact approval workflow.)

Ask:
	15.	How does the quarantine flow work in hybrid mode?

	•	Does SaaS decide allow/deny and push the decision to on-prem?

	16.	Can we customize quarantine logic per repository?

	•	E.g., prod repos more strict.

	17.	Can Lifecycle/FW enforce retention of approved components only?
	18.	What are the reporting dashboards in hybrid mode?

	•	Do we see all repos (on-prem + cloud) in one UI?

⸻

✅ 5. Performance & Scalability
	19.	Any performance impact on download/upload when hybrid scanning is used?
	20.	Does scanning happen asynchronously?
	21.	What is the typical latency for allow/deny decision from SaaS?

⸻

✅ 6. Cost, Licensing & Sizing
	22.	What is the correct sizing for on-prem Nexus Repository Pro?

	•	of developers, artifact size, concurrent builds, etc.

	23.	Are Firewall + Lifecycle licensed per developer, per repo, or per component?
	24.	Is hybrid priced differently than full on-prem?
	25.	What discounts exist for long-term commitments (3–5 years)?

⸻

✅ 7. Migration from OSS → Pro

You currently use Nexus OSS, so ask:
	26.	What is the recommended migration path from Nexus OSS → Pro?
	27.	Is there downtime required?
	28.	Are all existing repos compatible?
	29.	Any DB/schema migration steps?
	30.	Can you help automated migration tests?

⸻

✅ 8. Product Roadmap (Critical for long-term decision vs JFrog)
	31.	Is SaaS Lifecycle/Firewall the strategic direction?

	•	Or are there major changes coming?

	32.	What major features are planned in the next 12–24 months?
	33.	How long will on-prem Nexus Repository be supported?

⸻

✅ 9. Comparison vs JFrog (ask diplomatically)
	34.	How does Sonatype Lifecycle/FW compare with JFrog Xray on:

	•	accuracy of CVEs
	•	false positives
	•	language support
	•	license rules
	•	speed of scanning
	•	quarantine features
	•	SBOM generation

	35.	Does Sonatype provide a better “source of truth” for vulnerabilities than NVD alone?

	•	(This is their strong point — let them explain.)

⸻

✅ 10. Operational Concerns
	36.	Are there backup/restore procedures for hybrid mode?
	37.	How do upgrades work (on-prem + SaaS interactions)?
	38.	Is there a high-availability configuration recommended for Nexus Pro?
	39.	Logs & monitoring: what is visible to us vs stored in SaaS?

⸻

⚡ Quick Version (30-second summary for the meeting)

If you need to go fast:

“We want Nexus Pro on-prem, but Lifecycle/Firewall as SaaS.
We need to understand:
	•	Integration architecture & requirements
	•	Quarantine flow in hybrid mode
	•	CI/CD scan automation
	•	SBOM + license enforcement
	•	Migration path OSS → Pro
	•	Cost/licensing model
	•	Roadmap + support timeline
	•	Comparison points vs JFrog Xray
	•	Operational risks (HA, upgrades, outages)”**
