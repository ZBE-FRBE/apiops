Meeting: Sonatype – Hybrid Nexus + Firewall + Lifecycle

Date:
Participants (Our side):
Participants (Sonatype):

⸻

1. Context (our needs)
	•	On-prem Nexus Repository OSS → Pro migration.
	•	Want Sonatype Firewall + Lifecycle as SaaS, Nexus Repository on-prem.
	•	CI/CD: GitLab CE + Jenkins (on-prem), GitHub Actions + (possibly Azure DevOps) in cloud.
	•	Goal: central artifact store + automated security / license governance with minimal infra overhead.

⸻

2. Proposed Architecture (from Sonatype)
	•	Deployment model:
	•	Nexus Repository Pro: on-prem (VM / Kubernetes / etc.).
	•	Firewall / Lifecycle: SaaS in region: ______
	•	Connector/agent: ______ (outbound only? URLs/IPs?)
	•	Data flows:
	•	Dev tools → Nexus Pro → (SaaS FW/Lifecycle decision) → quarantine / release.
	•	SBOM / reports stored where? ______

⸻

3. Security & Compliance
	•	Authentication/authorization model (Nexus users & roles, SSO?): ______
	•	Network requirements (outbound only? ports? proxies?): ______
	•	Data sent to SaaS (components metadata? SBOM? source?) : ______
	•	Data residency (EU or specific region): ______
	•	How policies are defined and enforced (license, CVE severity, quarantines): ______

⸻

4. CI/CD & Tool Integration
	•	Supported ecosystems: Maven, Gradle, npm, pip, Docker, etc.: ______
	•	Integration with:
	•	GitLab CE / Jenkins: ______
	•	GitHub Actions: ______
	•	Azure DevOps (pipelines, feeds): ______
	•	PR/MR blocking or quality gates: ______

⸻

5. Operations & Migration
	•	OSS → Pro migration steps & downtime: ______
	•	Backup / restore procedures: ______
	•	HA and scaling approach: ______
	•	Upgrades (Repo Pro vs SaaS services): ______

⸻

6. Licensing / Pricing (high level)
	•	License model (per dev / per app / other): ______
	•	Estimated sizing for our context (#devs, #artifacts): ______
	•	Any constraints/limits (repos, requests, component volume): ______

⸻

7. Next Steps
	•	PoC scope: ______
	•	Responsibilities (Sonatype vs us): ______
	•	Target timeline: ______

2️⃣ Target solution: how it would work with Sonatype (structure for your doc)

You can later turn this into a proper architecture doc. For now, think in 4 sections; I’ll give you bullet content you can reuse.

⸻

A. High-level architecture
	•	Core repository:
	•	One Nexus Repository Pro on-prem (replacing OSS).
	•	Acts as single source of truth for:
	•	Maven / Gradle (Java, Scala, Kotlin),
	•	npm / Node,
	•	Python (pip),
	•	Docker images,
	•	possibly NuGet if needed.
	•	Security brain in SaaS:
	•	Sonatype Firewall (SaaS): controls what can enter from external sources (Maven Central, npm registry, Docker Hub…).
	•	Sonatype Lifecycle (SaaS): analyses artifacts (incl. transitive deps), enforces policies in CI/CD and in repos, provides dashboards, SBOM, license views.
	•	Hybrid link:
	•	Nexus Pro sends component coordinates + hashes/metadata to SaaS for evaluation.
	•	SaaS returns policy decisions (allow, warn, quarantine, fail build).
	•	Network is outbound-only from your DC to Sonatype SaaS through proxy/firewall.

You can draw a simple diagram:

Dev tools (Maven/Gradle/npm/pip/Docker + CI/CD) → Nexus Pro (on-prem) → Sonatype SaaS (Firewall/Lifecycle) → decision → Nexus (release or quarantine) → deploy to environments.

⸻

B. Security model (what you can say clearly)

You want to show Security / Risk teams that this is controlled:
	1.	Network & isolation
	•	Nexus Pro stays on-prem in our DC (or private cloud).
	•	Only outbound HTTPS connections from Nexus / scan agents to Sonatype SaaS endpoints.
	•	No inbound traffic from internet to our network.
	•	All traffic goes through our corporate proxy / firewall rules.
	2.	Identity & access
	•	Nexus Pro:
	•	Integrated with our corporate IdP / LDAP / AD / Entra ID for SSO (if we choose).
	•	Repos secured by roles (dev, ops, release manager, etc.).
	•	Sonatype SaaS UI:
	•	Access controlled by Sonatype’s own IAM / SSO integration (ask them which: SAML / OIDC).
	•	Only security / platform / lead dev profiles get access.
	3.	Data sent to SaaS
	•	Typically: component GAV/coordinates, checksums, metadata, SBOM – not full proprietary source code.
	•	Ask them to confirm exact data categories and data residency (EU/EEA ideally).
	•	Policies & scan results are stored in SaaS; only package artifacts remain in your Nexus on-prem.
	4.	Policies & enforcement
	•	Define policies like:
	•	Block CVEs >= Critical
	•	Warn for High
	•	Ban certain licenses (GPLv3, AGPL, etc.)
	•	Firewall applies these on inbound components (from remote repos).
	•	Lifecycle applies them on builds (CI/CD) and repos (existing components).
	•	If SaaS unavailable:
	•	Define fallback behavior (fail closed vs fail open; ask this explicitly).

You can summarise:

“Nexus is our controlled internal store. Firewall + Lifecycle in SaaS act as a policy decision service for security and licenses, via outbound-only connections, with no source code pushed out.”

⸻

C. CI/CD integration (GitLab/Jenkins/GitHub/Azure DevOps)

You’ll say in the doc:
	•	All CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) consume and publish artifacts via Nexus Pro.
	•	Lifecycle provides:
	•	Build plugins (e.g. Maven, Gradle, npm, etc.) so that each build is scanned.
	•	Optionally quality gates: pipeline fails if policy is violated.
	•	You can standardize on:
	•	A shared CI template (GitLab YAML / Jenkins shared library / ADO pipeline template) that:
	•	builds,
	•	runs tests,
	•	runs Sonatype Lifecycle scan,
	•	pushes artifact → Nexus Pro → potentially quarantined or released.

⸻

D. Migration from Nexus OSS → Pro + SaaS

High-level steps:
	1.	Inventory existing repos and formats.
	2.	Install Nexus Pro in parallel or upgrade existing OSS to Pro (ask Sonatype what they recommend).
	3.	Configure security & roles (reuse existing, harden where needed).
	4.	Connect Nexus Pro to Sonatype SaaS (Firewall/Lifecycle).
	5.	Enable policies in “monitor” mode first (do not block, just observe).
	6.	After a PoC / pilot, switch to “enforce” mode: block new critical CVEs / banned licenses.
	7.	Gradually onboard all CI/CD pipelines.

3️⃣ Azure DevOps + Nexus Pro: is it possible?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely.
